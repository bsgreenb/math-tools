    "In the previous section, we went from $A$ to $U$ with elimination.  In this section, we look at elimination in the most useful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many key ideas of linear algebra, when you look at them closely, are really _factorizations_ of a matrix. The first factorization we look at comes from elimination.  The factors $L$ and $U$ are triangular matrices. The factorization that comes from elimination is $A=LU$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know about $U$, the upper triangular matrix, from producing it during elimination. Reversing those steps, taking $U$ back to $A$ is achieved by a lower triangular $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each elimination step $E_{ij}$ is inverted by $L_{ij}$. The entries of $L$ are exactly the multipliers $l_{ij}$. Every multiplier $l_{ij}$ is in row $i$, column $j$ of $L$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line is our factorization $LU=A$. The whole forward elimination process (with no row exchanges) is inverted by $L$.  Just as $E$ is all eliminations, $L$ is all the inverse eliminations.\n",

    "### How expensive is elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage of elimination produces zeros below the first pivot in column 1. To find each entry below the pivot requires one multiplication and one subtraction. We count this first stage as $n^2$ multiplications and $n^2$ subtractions. It is actually less ($n^2 -n$) because row 1 doesn't change.\n",

For considering the cost/complexity here, we can just pay attention to the largest term, and say:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elimination on A requires about $\\frac{1}{3}n^3$ multiplications and $\\frac{1}{3}n^3$ subtractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the right side? Going forward, we subtract multiple of $b_1$ from the components below. This is $n-1$ steps. The second stage takes only $n-2$ steps, because $b_1$ is not involved. The last stage of forward elimination takes one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for back substitution, $x_n$ takes one step (divide by the last pivot).  The next unknown takes two steps. When we reach $x_1$ it will require $n$ steps ($n-1$ substitutions of the other unknowns, then division by the first pivot). \n",
    "\n",
    "The total count on the right side, from $b$ to $c$ to $x$, forward and backward, is therefore exactly $n^2$, which we can see from:\n",

    "\n",
    "The true dimension of the column space is the rank $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **basis** for a space are independent vectors that span the space.  Every vector in the space is a unique combination of the basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dimension** of a space is the number of vectors in a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of $A$ are **linearly independent** when the only solution to $Ax=0$ is $x=0$.  Or put another way, the columns are independent when the nullspace $N(A)$ contains only the zero vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, if three vectors are not in the same plane, they are independent.  Conversely, if three vectors are in the same plane, they are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal definition of linear independence covers more broadly combinations of vectors not in a matrix $A$, i.e sequences of vectors.  Same idea though; the only linear combination of them that equals 0 should occur when you take 0 times each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a sequence containing the zero vector will always be dependent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Three vectors in $R^2$ cannot be independent.  A couple of ways of seeing this. One is that the matrix $A$ with those three columns must have a free variable and then a special solution to $Ax=0$.  Another way: if the two vectors are independent, some combination of them will produce the third vector, because they fill up $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we get a three vectors in $R^3$, and we're asked to determine if they're dependent.  We could see this by plugging them into a 3x3 matrix $A$ and seeing if $Ax=0$ has a non-zero solution.  If it does, they're dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a square matrix, dependent columns imply dependent rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "When vectors are independent, the matrix of independent columns will be of full column rank. Whereas any set of vectors in $R^m$ must be linearly dependent if $n > m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The columns might be dependent or independent, if $n \\le m$.  Elimination will reveal the pivot columns, which are the independent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors that span a subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors **spans** a space if their linear combinations fill the space.  For example, $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$ and  $\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$ span all of $R^2$. $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$ and  $\\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\\\ -1\\end{bmatrix}$ only span a line in $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's fine to \"overkill\" on a span, like have another vector that doesn't add anything, so long as it's spanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce a new subspace, which is spanned by the rows.  The combination of the rows produces the **row space** in $R^n$.  The row space of $A$ is the column space of $A^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A basis for a vector space\n",
    "\n",
    "We want enough independent vectors to span a space, and not more. A **basis** for a vector space, defined as a sequence of vectors which are linearly independent and span the space, provides this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of the $n$ by $n$ identity matrix give the **standard basis** for $R^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns for every invertible $n$ by $n$ matrix give a basis for $R^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ are a basis for $R^n$ precisely when they are the columns of an $n$ by $n$ invertible matrix. Thus $R^n$ has infinitely many different bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that going from $A$ to $R$, the column spaces/bases change, while retaining the same dimension.  But row space however does not change between $A$ and $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension of a vector space\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of vectors in every basis is the **dimension** of the space. A line has dimension 1, a plane dimension 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column Space of $A$ has dimension $r$, and the nullspace of $A$ has dimension $n-r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bases for Matrix Spaces and Function Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence/basis/dimension is not limited to column vectors.  We can apply these concepts to matrices and functions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask whether matrices are dependent by asking whether some combination of them produces the zero matrix.  And we can ask the dimenion, for example the dimension of a 3 by 4 matrix space is 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dimension of the whole $n$ by $n$ matrix space is $n^2$\n",

    "- The dimension of the subspace of diagonal matrices is $n$.\n",
    "- The dimension of the subspace of symmetric matrices is $\\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In differential equations $d^2y/dx^2 = y$ has a space of solutions. One basis is $y = e^x$ and $y = e^{-x}$.  The dimension there is 2, because of the second derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y'' =0$ is solved by any linear function $y = cx + d$\n",
    "- $y'' = -y$ is solved by any combination $y = c\\sin{x} + d\\cos{x}$\n",
    "- $y'' = y$ is solved by any combination $y = ce^x + de^{-x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "That solution space for $y'' = -y$ has two basis functions: $\\sin{x}$ and $\\cos{x}$. The space for $y'' = 0$ has $x$ and $1$.  It is the \"nullspace\" of the second derivative.  The dimension in each case is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions of $y'' = 2$ don't form a subspace, because the rightside $b=2$ is not zero.  A particular solution is $x^2$.  The complete solution is $y(x) = x^2 + cx + d$.  All those functions satisfy $y'' = 2$.  Notice the particular solution plus any function $cx + d$ in the nullspace.  A linear differential equation is like a linear matrix equation $Ax=b$, but we solve it by calculus instead of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basis of space Z\n",
    "\n",
    "The space $Z$ contains only the zero vector. The dimension of this space is zero. The empty set (containing no vectors) is a basis for $Z$. We can never allow the zero vector into a basis, because then linear independence is lost.\n",

    "Symmetric meaning $S = S^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no exaggeration to say that symmetric matrices $S$ are the most important matrices the world will ever see-- in the theory of linear algebra but also in the applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is special about $Sx = \\lambda x$ when $S$ is symmetric?  The diagonalization $S = X\\Lambda X^{-1}$ will reflect the symmetry of $S$.  We get some hint by transposing $S^T = (X^{-1})^T\\Lambda X^T$.  (Recall from our chapter on Transposes: The transpose of $AB$ is $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$). Those are the same since $S = S^T$. Possibly $X^{-1}$ in the first form equals $X^T$ in the second form? Then $X^TX = I$.  That makes each eigenvector in $X$ orthogonal to the other eigenvectors when $S=S^T$.  Here are the key facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A symmetric matrix has only real eigenvalues.\n",
    "2. The eigenvectors can be chosen orthonormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those $n$ orthonormal eigenvectors go into the columns of $X$.  Every symmetric matrix can be diagonalized (note that diagonalization and invertibility do not imply one another).  Its eigenvectors matrix $X$ becomes an orthogonal matrix $Q$.  Orthogonal matrices have $Q^{-1} = Q^T$-- what we suspected about the eigenvector matrix is true.  To remember it we write $Q$ instead of $X$, when we choose orthonormal eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use the word \"choose\"?  Because the eigenvectors do not _have_ to be unit vectors.  Their lengths are at our disposal.  We will choose unit vectors-- eigenvectors of length one, which are orthonormal and not just orthogonal.  Then $A = X\\Lambda X^{-1}$ is in its special and paticular form $S = Q\\Lambda Q^T$ for symmetric matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectral Theorem**: Every symmetric matrix has the factorization $S = Q\\Lambda Q^T$ with real eigenvalues in $\\Lambda$ and orthonormal eigenvectors in the columns of $Q$.  **Symmetric diagonalization**:\n",

    "It is easy to see that $Q\\Lambda Q^T$ is symmetric.  Take its transpose.  You get $(Q^T)^T\\Lambda^TQ^T$, which is $Q\\Lambda Q^T$ again.  The harder part is to prove that every symmetric matrix has real $\\lambda$'s and orthonormal $x$'s.  This is the \"spectral theorem\" in geometry and physics.  We have to prove it!  No choice.  We'll approach the proof in three steps:\n",

The determinant of $S - \\lambda I$ is $\\lambda^2 - 5\\lambda$.  The eigenvalues are 0 and 5 (both real).  We can see them directly: $\\lambda = 0$ is an eigenvalues because $S$ is singular, and $\\lambda = 5$ matches the trace down the diagonal of $S$: 0 + 5 agrees with 1 + 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two eigenvectors are $(2, -1)$ and $(1,2)$-- orthogonal but not yet orthonormal.  The eigenvector for $\\lambda = 0$ is in the nullspace of $A$.  The eigenvector for $\\lambda = 5$ is in the column space.  We ask ourselves, why are the nullspace and column space perpindicular?  The Fundamental Theorem says that the nullspace is perpindicular to the row space-- not the column space.  But our matrix is symmetric!  Its row and column spaces are the same.  Its eigenvectors $(2, -1)$ and $(1,2)$ must be (and are) perpindicular.\n",

The eigenvalues are changing as the \"3\" in $L$ moves to zero.  But to change _sign_, a real eigenvalues would have to cross zero.  The matrix would at that moment be singular.  Our changing matrix always has pivots 1 and -8, so it is never singular.  The signs cannot change, as the $\\lambda$'s move to the $d$'s.\n",

Similarly the vector $(1, i)$ is orthogonal to the vector $(1, -i)$.  Their inner product is 1 - 1.  We are correctly getting zero for the inner product-- where we would be incorrectly getting zero for the length of $(1,i)$ if we forgot to take the conjugate.\n",

Even the square roots of 1 are seen, with $w_2 = e^{i2\\pi/2} = -1$. Do not despise those square roots 1 and -1.  The idea behing the FFT is to go from an 8 by 8 fourier matrix (containing powers of $w_8$) to the 4 by 4 matrix below (with powers of $w_4 = i$).  The same idea goes from 4 to 2.  By exploiting the connections of $F_8$ down to $F_4$ and up to $F_{16}$ (and beyond), the FFT makes multiplication by $F_{1024}$ very quick.\n",
