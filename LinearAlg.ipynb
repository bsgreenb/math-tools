    "In the previous section, we went from $A$ to $U$ with elimination.  In this section, we look at elimination in the most useful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many key ideas of linear algebra, when you look at them closely, are really _factorizations_ of a matrix. The first factorization we look at comes from elimination.  The factors $L$ and $U$ are triangular matrices. The factorization that comes from elimination is $A=LU$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know about $U$, the upper triangular matrix, from producing it during elimination. Reversing those steps, taking $U$ back to $A$ is achieved by a lower triangular $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each elimination step $E_{ij}$ is inverted by $L_{ij}$. The entries of $L$ are exactly the multipliers $l_{ij}$. Every multiplier $l_{ij}$ is in row $i$, column $j$ of $L$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line is our factorization $LU=A$. The whole forward elimination process (with no row exchanges) is inverted by $L$.  Just as $E$ is all eliminations, $L$ is all the inverse eliminations.\n",

    "### How expensive is elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage of elimination produces zeros below the first pivot in column 1. To find each entry below the pivot requires one multiplication and one subtraction. We count this first stage as $n^2$ multiplications and $n^2$ subtractions. It is actually less ($n^2 -n$) because row 1 doesn't change.\n",

For considering the cost/complexity here, we can just pay attention to the largest term, and say:\n",
    "\n",
    "Elimination on A requires about $\\frac{1}{3}n^3$ multiplications and $\\frac{1}{3}n^3$ subtractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the right side? Going forward, we subtract multiple of $b_1$ from the components below. This is $n-1$ steps. The second stage takes only $n-2$ steps, because $b_1$ is not involved. The last stage of forward elimination takes one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for back substitution, $x_n$ takes one step (divide by the last pivot).  The next unknown takes two steps. When we reach $x_1$ it will require $n$ steps ($n-1$ substitutions of the other unknowns, then division by the first pivot). \n",
    "\n",
    "The total count on the right side, from $b$ to $c$ to $x$, forward and backward, is therefore exactly $n^2$, which we can see from:\n",

    "\n",
    "The true dimension of the column space is the rank $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **basis** for a space are independent vectors that span the space.  Every vector in the space is a unique combination of the basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dimension** of a space is the number of vectors in a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of $A$ are **linearly independent** when the only solution to $Ax=0$ is $x=0$.  Or put another way, the columns are independent when the nullspace $N(A)$ contains only the zero vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, if three vectors are not in the same plane, they are independent.  Conversely, if three vectors are in the same plane, they are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal definition of linear independence covers more broadly combinations of vectors not in a matrix $A$, i.e sequences of vectors.  Same idea though; the only linear combination of them that equals 0 should occur when you take 0 times each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a sequence containing the zero vector will always be dependent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Three vectors in $R^2$ cannot be independent.  A couple of ways of seeing this. One is that the matrix $A$ with those three columns must have a free variable and then a special solution to $Ax=0$.  Another way: if the two vectors are independent, some combination of them will produce the third vector, because they fill up $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we get a three vectors in $R^3$, and we're asked to determine if they're dependent.  We could see this by plugging them into a 3x3 matrix $A$ and seeing if $Ax=0$ has a non-zero solution.  If it does, they're dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a square matrix, dependent columns imply dependent rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "When vectors are independent, the matrix of independent columns will be of full column rank. Whereas any set of vectors in $R^m$ must be linearly dependent if $n > m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The columns might be dependent or independent, if $n \\le m$.  Elimination will reveal the pivot columns, which are the independent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors that span a subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors **spans** a space if their linear combinations fill the space.  For example, $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$ and  $\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$ span all of $R^2$. $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$ and  $\\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\\\ -1\\end{bmatrix}$ only span a line in $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's fine to \"overkill\" on a span, like have another vector that doesn't add anything, so long as it's spanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce a new subspace, which is spanned by the rows.  The combination of the rows produces the **row space** in $R^n$.  The row space of $A$ is the column space of $A^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A basis for a vector space\n",
    "\n",
    "We want enough independent vectors to span a space, and not more. A **basis** for a vector space, defined as a sequence of vectors which are linearly independent and span the space, provides this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of the $n$ by $n$ identity matrix give the **standard basis** for $R^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns for every invertible $n$ by $n$ matrix give a basis for $R^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ are a basis for $R^n$ precisely when they are the columns of an $n$ by $n$ invertible matrix. Thus $R^n$ has infinitely many different bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that going from $A$ to $R$, the column spaces/bases change, while retaining the same dimension.  But row space however does not change between $A$ and $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension of a vector space\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of vectors in every basis is the **dimension** of the space. A line has dimension 1, a plane dimension 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column Space of $A$ has dimension $r$, and the nullspace of $A$ has dimension $n-r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bases for Matrix Spaces and Function Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence/basis/dimension is not limited to column vectors.  We can apply these concepts to matrices and functions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask whether matrices are dependent by asking whether some combination of them produces the zero matrix.  And we can ask the dimenion, for example the dimension of a 3 by 4 matrix space is 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dimension of the whole $n$ by $n$ matrix space is $n^2$\n",

    "- The dimension of the subspace of diagonal matrices is $n$.\n",
    "- The dimension of the subspace of symmetric matrices is $\\frac{1}{2}n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In differential equations $d^2y/dx^2 = y$ has a space of solutions. One basis is $y = e^x$ and $y = e^{-x}$.  The dimension there is 2, because of the second derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y'' =0$ is solved by any linear function $y = cx + d$\n",
    "- $y'' = -y$ is solved by any combination $y = c\\sin{x} + d\\cos{x}$\n",
    "- $y'' = y$ is solved by any combination $y = ce^x + de^{-x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "That solution space for $y'' = -y$ has two basis functions: $\\sin{x}$ and $\\cos{x}$. The space for $y'' = 0$ has $x$ and $1$.  It is the \"nullspace\" of the second derivative.  The dimension in each case is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions of $y'' = 2$ don't form a subspace, because the rightside $b=2$ is not zero.  A particular solution is $x^2$.  The complete solution is $y(x) = x^2 + cx + d$.  All those functions satisfy $y'' = 2$.  Notice the particular solution plus any function $cx + d$ in the nullspace.  A linear differential equation is like a linear matrix equation $Ax=b$, but we solve it by calculus instead of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basis of space Z\n",
    "\n",
    "The space $Z$ contains only the zero vector. The dimension of this space is zero. The empty set (containing no vectors) is a basis for $Z$. We can never allow the zero vector into a basis, because then linear independence is lost.\n",

    "Unlike the determinant, the cross product is a vector rather than a number.  Let's first go over the formula for cross product.  The cross product of $u = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$ is the vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{u} \\times \\boldsymbol{v}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{i} & \\boldsymbol{j} & \\boldsymbol{k} \\\\\n",
    "u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\\\\n",
    "v_1 & v_2 & v_3\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right|=\\left(u_2 v_3-u_3 v_2\\right) \\boldsymbol{i}+\\left(u_3 v_1-u_1 v_3\\right) \\boldsymbol{j}+\\left(u_1 v_2-u_2 v_1\\right) \\boldsymbol{k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector $u \\times v$ is perpindicular to $u$ and $v$.  The cross product $v \\times u$ is $-(u \\times v)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This 3x3 determinant is the easiest way to remember how to calculate a cross product. In the determinant, the vector $i = (1,0,0)$ multiplies $u_2v_3$ and $-u_3v_2$.  The result is $(u_2v_3, u_3v_2, 0, 0)$, which is the first component of the cross product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the cyclic pattern of the subscripts. 2 and 3 give component 1 of $u \\times v$, then 3 and 1 give component 2, then 1 and 2 give component 3.  This completes our definition of $u \\times v$.  Now let's list the properties of the cross-product:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $v \\times u$ reverses rows 2 and 3 in the determinant so it equals $-(u \\times v)$.\n",
    "2. The cross product $u \\times v$ is perpindicular to $u$ (and also to $v$).  The direct proof is to watch terms cancel, producing a zero dot product: $\\boldsymbol{\\iota} \\cdot(\\boldsymbol{u} \\times \\boldsymbol{v})=u_1\\left(u_2 v_3-u_3 v_2\\right)+u_2\\left(u_3 v_1-u_1 v_3\\right)+u_3\\left(u_1 v_2-u_2 v_1\\right)=0$.  The determinant for $u \\cdot (u \\times v)$ has rows $u, u$, and $v$ (2 equal rows) so it is zero.\n",
    "3. The cross product of any vector with itself (two equal rows) is $u \\times u = 0$.  When $u$ and $v$ are parallel, the cross product is zero.  When $u$ and $v$ are perpindicular, the dot product is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of $u \\times v$ equals the area of the parallelogram with sides $u$ and $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triple product = Determinant = Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $u \\times v$ is a vectort, we can take its dot product with a third vector $w$.  That produces the **triple product** $(u \\times v) \\cdot w$.  It is called a \"scalar\" triple product, because it is a number.  In fact it is a determinant-- it gives the volume of the $u, v, w$ box:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(\\boldsymbol{u} \\times \\boldsymbol{v}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{w}=\\left|\\begin{array}{lll}\n",
    "w_1 & w_2 & w_3 \\\\\n",
    "u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\\\\n",
    "v_1 & v_2 & v_3\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right|=\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\\\\n",
    "v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\\\\n",
    "w_1 & w_2 & w_3\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can put $w$ in the top row or the bottom row.  The determinants are the same because two row exchanges go from one to the other. $(u \\times v) \\cdot w = 0$ exactly when the vectors lie in the same plane.\n",
