    "> In number theory and combinatorics, a **partition** of a positive integer $n$, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. (If order matters, the sum becomes a composition.) For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:\n",

    "&2+2 \\\\\n",
    "&2+1+1 \\\\\n",
    "&1+1+1+1\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    ">The order-dependent composition $1+3$ is the same partition as $3+1$, and the two distinct compositions $1+2+1$ and $1+1+2$ represent the same partition $2+1+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A summand in a partition is also called a **part**. The number of partitions of $n$ is given by the partition function $p(n)$. So $p(4)=5$. The notation $\\lambda \\vdash n$ means that $\\lambda$ is a partition of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Partition Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory)). By convention p(0) = 1, as there is one way (the empty sum) of representing zero as a sum of positive integers. For the same reason, by definition, p(n) = 0 when n is negative. \n",
