    "The partial derivative only cares about the changing of one of the variables in a multivariable function.  For example, the partial derivative with respect to $x$ of $f(x,y)$ would be: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$.  Notationally, we can also represent a partial derivative with respect to $x$ as $f_x$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use the notation $\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x^2}$ to indicate the double partial derivative with respect to $x$.  To indicate the derivative with respect to $x$ then the derivative of that with respect to $y$, we would write: $\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial y \\partial x}$.  Sometimes you may see a notation $f_{xx}$ or $f_{xy}$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we'll find is that there's often a symmetry between second partial derivatives.  When that symmetry is there, applying the partial derivative with respect to $y$ then with respect to $x$ is equivalent to doing partial with respect to $x$ then with respect to $y$.  In these cases ${\\partial^2f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = {\\partial^2f}{\\partial x \\partial y}$.  The conditions for this symmetry existing are [described here on wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_of_second_derivatives).  Most of the time we'll find this to be true, the exceptions occur when there's not continuity at the key point.\n",

The **radius of curvature** is the radius of that circle.  The actual amount of curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of curvature, $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{R}$.\n",

We can express the unit tangent vector as a function of time by dividing out the magnitude, which normalizes to unit vectors:\n",
