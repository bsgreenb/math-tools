    "# Algebras\n",
    "\n",
    "Every **algebra** consists of a set and certain operations on that set.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **algebraic structure** is a set with one or more operations defined on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "An **operation** $\\circ$ on $A$ is a rule which assigns to each ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements of A exactly one element $a \\circ b$ in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algebraic Properties\n",
    "Properties of operations on a set $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Closure**: The operation on elements in $A$ always produces another element of $A$.\n",
    "* **Commutativity**:  $a \\circ b = b \\circ a $ for any two elements $a$ and $b$ in $A$. \n",
    "* **Associativity**: $(a \\circ b) \\circ c = a \\circ (b \\circ c)$ for any three elements $a,b,c$ in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other algebraic properties include existence of an identity/neutral element, existence of an inverses of all elements, and distributivity (which applices to structures with multiple operations).  More on all these to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neutral Element\n",
    "If there exists an element $e$ in $A$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$e \\circ a = a$ and $a \\circ e = a$ for every $a$ in $A$\n",
    "\n",
    "we call $e$ an **identity element** aka **neutral element** for the operation $\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "0 is identity element for addition, 1 for multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inverses \n",
    "\n",
    "An **inverse** $a^{-1}$ is defined by causing $a$ to reach the neutral element $e$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a \\circ a^{-1} = e$ and $a^{-1} \\circ a = e$"
