    "# Algebras\n",
    "\n",
    "Every **algebra** consists of a set and certain operations on that set.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **algebraic structure** is a set with one or more operations defined on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "An **operation** $\\circ$ on $A$ is a rule which assigns to each ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements of A exactly one element $a \\circ b$ in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algebraic Properties\n",
    "Properties of operations on a set $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Closure**: The operation on elements in $A$ always produces another element of $A$.\n",
    "* **Commutativity**:  $a \\circ b = b \\circ a $ for any two elements $a$ and $b$ in $A$. \n",
    "* **Associativity**: $(a \\circ b) \\circ c = a \\circ (b \\circ c)$ for any three elements $a,b,c$ in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other algebraic properties include existence of an identity/neutral element, existence of an inverses of all elements, and distributivity (which applices to structures with multiple operations).  More on all these to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neutral Element\n",
    "If there exists an element $e$ in $A$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$e \\circ a = a$ and $a \\circ e = a$ for every $a$ in $A$\n",
    "\n",
    "we call $e$ an **identity element** aka **neutral element** for the operation $\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "0 is identity element for addition, 1 for multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inverses \n",
    "\n",
    "An **inverse** $a^{-1}$ is defined by causing $a$ to reach the neutral element $e$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a \\circ a^{-1} = e$ and $a^{-1} \\circ a = e$"

    "# Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "A **group** is a set $G$ with an operation $\\circ$ which satisfies the axioms:\n",
    "1. $\\circ$ is associative.\n",
    "2. There is an element $e$ in $G$ such that $a \\circ e = a$ and $e \\circ a = a$ for every element $a$ in $G$.\n",
    "3. For every element $a$ in $G$, there is an element $a^{âˆ’1}$ in $G$ such that $a \\circ a^{-1} = e$ and $a^{-1} \\circ a = e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation for the above group would be $\\left<G, \\circ\\right>$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the commutative law holds in a group $G$, such a group is called an **abelian group** or a **commutative group**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of elements in a finite group $G$ is called its **order**.  It's denoted by $|G|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that two elements in a group **commute** if $ab = ba$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **direct product** of a group $G \\times H = \\{(x, y) : x \\in G \\land y \\in H\\}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Every finite group can be represented by a **Cayley Diagram**.  Each point is an element of the group, and the directional arrows indicate the result of multiplying by their generators.  Different line colors or dottings can be used to indicate which generator an arrow refers to.  There are no arrows when there's bidirectionality because a given generator is its own inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G$ be a group, and $S$ a nonempty subset of $G$. If the product of every pair of elements of $S$ is in $S$, we say that $S$ is **closed with respect to multiplication**. If the inverse of every element of $S$ is in $S$, we say that $S$ is **closed with respect to inverses**. If both of these are true, we call $S$ a **subgroup** of $G$ (and itself a group).\n",
    "\n",
    "In any group $G$ the one-element subset $\\{e\\}$, containing only the neutral element, is a subgroup. At the other extreme, the whole group $G$ is obviously a subgroup of itself. These two examples are, respectively, the smallest and largest possible subgroups of $G$. They are called the **trivial subgroups** of $G$. All the other subgroups of $G$ are called **proper subgroups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **generator** of a group $G$ is a subset $S \\subseteq G$ such that every element of $G$ can be expressed as a finite product of elements from $S$ and their inverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **subgroup generated by** a subset $S$, denoted $\\langle S \\rangle$, of a group $G$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $S$, equivalently the set of all finite products of elements of $S$ and their inverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of equations, involving only the generators and their inverses, is called a set of **defining equations** for $G$ if these equations completely determine the multiplication table of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the **center** of a group $G$ we mean the set of all the elements of $G$ which commute with every element of $G$, that is,\n",
