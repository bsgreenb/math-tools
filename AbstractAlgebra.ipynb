Different line colors or dottings can be used to indicate which generator an arrow refers to.  There are no arrows when there's bidirectionality because a given generator is its own inverse.\n",

If the inverse of every element of $S$ is in $S$, we say that $S$ is **closed with respect to inverses**. If both of these are true, we call $S$ a **subgroup** of $G$ (and itself a group).\n",

    "In any group $G$ the one-element subset $\\{e\\}$, containing only the neutral element, is a subgroup. At the other extreme, the whole group $G$ is obviously a subgroup of itself. These two examples are, respectively, the smallest and largest possible subgroups of $G$. They are called the **trivial subgroups** of $G$. All the other subgroups of $G$ are called **proper subgroups**.\n",

(Note the conection with modular addition: a cycle maps $a_i$ $a_{i+1 \\mod s}$\n",

A permutation is called **even** if it is a product of an even number of transpositions, and **odd** if it is a product of an odd number of transpositions.\n",
