    "\n",
    "First, as we will see in our examples, we will be able to show that there is a number $R$ so that the power series will converge for, $|x-a|<R$ and will diverge for $|x-a|>R$. This number is called the **radius of convergence** for the series. Note that the series may or may not converge if $|x-a|=R$. What happens at these points will not change the radius of convergence.\n",
