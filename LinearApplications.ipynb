    "A **graph** consists of **nodes** connected by **edges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **incidence matrix** of a graph tells us how $n$ nodes are connected by $m$ edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on incidence matrices, the laws of linear algebra become [Kirchoff's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry of an incidence matrix is 0 or 1 or -1.  This continues to apply after elimination.  All four subspaces in fact will use these simple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Incidence Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "If node one has an arrow to node two, the corresponding row for that edge will have a -1 in column 1 and a 1 in column 2.  The negative number means the arrow is going out from node 1, and the positive number means it's going into node 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](images/incidence-matrix-graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph is **complete**-- every pair of nodes is connected by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph with no closed loops is called a **tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of edges is $\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ and the minimum to connect all nodes in some way is $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elimination reduces every graph to a tree.  Loops produce dependent rows in $A$ and zero rows in echelon forms $U$ and $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $x$ is a vector of voltages at the nodes, $Ax$ gives the voltage differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kirchoff's Voltage Law**: The components of $Ax=b$ add to zero around every loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kirchoff's Current Law**: $A^Ty = 0$.  Flow in equals flow out at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incidence matrix $A$ comes from a connected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. The row space and column space have dimensions $r = n - 1$.  The nullspaces of $A$ and $A^T$ have dimensions 1 and $m-n + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $N(A)$ - The constant vectors $(c, c, \\dots, c)$ make up the nullspace of A.  dim = 1.\n",
    "* $C(A^T)$ - The edges of any tree give $r$ dependent rows of $A$: $r = n - 1$.\n",
    "* $C(A)$ - Voltage Law: The components of $Ax$ add to zero around all loops: dim = $n - 1$.\n",
    "* $N(A^T)$ - Current Law: $A^Ty = \\text{flow in - flow out} = 0$ is solved by loop currents.  There are $m - r = m - n + 1$ independent small loops in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every graph in a plane, linear algebra yields **Euler's formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{(number of nodes) - (number of edges) + (number of small loops)} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is saying $(n) - (m) + (m - n + 1) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a current source, Kirchoff's Current Law changes from $A^Ty = 0$ to $A^Ty = f$, to balanace the source $f$ from outside.  Flow into each node still equals flow out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltages and Currents and $A^TAx = f$\n",
    "\n",
    "[this is rather complex, will see if he covers it in lecture]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Networks and $A^TCA$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conductance** is the inverse of **resistance**, and measures how easily flow gets through.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **network** is graph that has conductance at each edge.  These numbers go into the conductance matrix $C$, which is diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ohm's Law**: $\\text{Current along edge = conductance times voltage difference.}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ohm's Law for all $m$ currents is $y = -CAx$.  The vector $Ax$ gives the potential differences, and $C$ multiplies by the conductances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Ohm's Law with Kirchoff's Current Law we get $A^TCAx = 0$."
