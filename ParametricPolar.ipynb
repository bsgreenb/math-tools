    "> A polar curve is a shape constructed using the polar coordinate system. Polar curves are defined by points that are a variable distance from the origin (the pole) depending on the angle measured off the positive xxx-axis. Polar curves can describe familiar Cartesian shapes such as ellipses as well as some unfamiliar shapes such as cardioids and lemniscates.\n",
